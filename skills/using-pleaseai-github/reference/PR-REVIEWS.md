# PR Reviews

Comprehensive guide to managing pull request reviews with the `gh-please` extension.

## Overview

The `gh-please` extension provides comprehensive PR review capabilities:

1. **pr review reply**: Respond to review comments
2. **pr review thread list**: List review threads with Node IDs
3. **pr review thread resolve**: Resolve review discussion threads
4. **pr review comment edit**: Edit review comments

These commands complement GitHub's web UI and provide CLI-based review workflows.

## pr review reply Command

### Purpose

Reply to pull request review comments programmatically from the command line.

### When to Use

**‚úÖ Good use cases:**
- Respond to multiple review comments quickly
- Scripted or automated responses
- CLI-centric workflows
- Batch processing feedback

**‚ùå Not suitable for:**
- Complex discussions (use GitHub UI)
- Nested replies (API limitation)
- Inline code suggestions

### Syntax

```bash
gh please pr review reply <comment-id> --body <text> [--repo owner/repo]
gh please pr review reply <comment-id> -b <text> [--repo owner/repo]

# From stdin
echo "text" | gh please pr review reply <comment-id> [--repo owner/repo]
```

**Note:** The old command `gh please pr review-reply` is deprecated but still works with a warning.

### Finding Comment Database IDs

**Method 1: GitHub Web UI (Recommended)**

1. Navigate to PR review comment
2. Check URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123#discussion_r1234567890`
3. Use number after `discussion_r`: `1234567890`

**Example:**
```
URL: https://github.com/pleaseai/gh-please/pull/456#discussion_r1234567890
Comment Database ID: 1234567890
```

**Method 2: List comments via gh CLI**

```bash
# View PR with comments
gh pr view 456 --json comments
```

**Note:** Use Database ID (numeric) for comment operations. For review threads, use Node ID from `gh please pr review thread list`.

### Basic Usage

**Simple reply:**
```bash
gh please pr review reply 1234567890 -b "Fixed in commit abc123"
```

**Multi-line reply:**
```bash
gh please pr review reply 1234567890 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Good catch! I've addressed this by:

1. Adding input validation
2. Including error handling
3. Adding unit tests

Let me know if you have other concerns.
EOF
)"
```

**From stdin:**
```bash
echo "Thanks for the review!" | gh please pr review reply 1234567890
```

**With template:**
```bash
# review-reply-template.txt
Thank you for the feedback!

I've updated the implementation as suggested:
- Added error handling
- Included tests
- Updated documentation

Please re-review when ready.

# Use template
gh please pr review reply 1234567890 --body "$(cat review-reply-template.txt)"
```

### Cross-repository Usage

```bash
# Reply to comment in different repo
gh please pr review reply 1234567890 -b "Fixed" --repo owner/repo
gh please pr review reply 1234567890 -b "Fixed" -R owner/repo  # Short form
```

### API Limitation: Top-level Comments Only

**Important:** The GitHub API endpoint only supports replies to **top-level review comments**, not nested replies.

**Endpoint used:**
```
POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies
```

**What works:**
```
PR #456
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Review Comment #1 (top-level)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Your reply (via gh please pr review reply 1)
```

**What doesn't work:**
```
PR #456
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Review Comment #1 (top-level)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Reply #2 (nested)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ùå Your reply (API doesn't support)
```

**Error message if you try:**
```bash
gh please pr review reply 2 -b "Reply to reply"
# Error: API error: Comment 2 is not a top-level review comment
```

**Workaround:**
- Use GitHub web UI for nested replies
- Reply to the original top-level comment instead

### Real-world Examples

**Example 1: Security Concern**

Review comment:
> "Using MD5 for password hashing is insecure"

Reply:
```bash
gh please pr review reply 111 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
You're absolutely right. I've updated to use bcrypt:

\`\`\`typescript
const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10)
\`\`\`

Changes in commit `a1b2c3d`. Tests updated accordingly.
EOF
)"
```

**Example 2: Performance Feedback**

Review comment:
> "This N+1 query will be slow with many users"

Reply:
```bash
gh please pr review reply 222 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Good catch! Fixed with eager loading:

Before:
\`\`\`typescript
for (const user of users) {
  user.posts = await getPosts(user.id)  // N+1
}
\`\`\`

After:
\`\`\`typescript
const users = await User.findAll({
  include: [Post]  // Single query with JOIN
})
\`\`\`

Benchmark: 500ms ‚Üí 50ms for 100 users.
EOF
)"
```

**Example 3: Batch Replies**

```bash
# Address multiple comments
COMMENTS=(111 222 333 444)
for id in "${COMMENTS[@]}"; do
  gh please pr review reply $id -b "Fixed in latest commit, please re-review"
done
```

## pr review thread list Command

### Purpose

List all review threads on a pull request with their Node IDs for use in resolve operations.

### Syntax

```bash
gh please pr review thread list <pr-number> [--unresolved-only] [--repo owner/repo]
```

### Basic Usage

**List all threads:**
```bash
gh please pr review thread list 456
```

**Output:**
```
üßµ Review Threads for PR #456

Thread PRRT_kwDOABC123 (unresolved)
  üìù src/auth.ts:45
  üí¨ "Add error handling here"
  üë§ reviewer1

  ‚ñ∂ Copy to resolve:
  gh please pr review thread resolve 456 --thread PRRT_kwDOABC123

Thread PRRT_kwDODEF456 (resolved)
  üìù src/utils.ts:12
  üí¨ "This could be optimized"
  üë§ reviewer2
  ‚úÖ Resolved by author

Summary: 2 total threads (1 unresolved, 1 resolved)
View: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/456
```

**List only unresolved threads:**
```bash
gh please pr review thread list 456 --unresolved-only
```

### Output Formats

Supports JSON, Markdown, and XML output:

```bash
# JSON for automation
gh please pr review thread list 456 --format json

# Markdown for documentation
gh please pr review thread list 456 --format markdown

# XML for LLM processing
gh please pr review thread list 456 --format xml
```

## pr review thread resolve Command

### Purpose

Resolve review discussion threads programmatically.

### When to Use

**‚úÖ Good use cases:**
- Mark conversations as resolved after addressing feedback
- Bulk resolve after comprehensive updates
- Automated workflows
- CLI-centric review processes

**‚ùå Not suitable for:**
- Unresolved discussions (keep open for visibility)
- Controversial feedback (discuss first)

### Syntax

```bash
# Resolve specific thread (use Node ID from thread list)
gh please pr review thread resolve <pr-number> --thread <thread-node-id> [--repo owner/repo]

# Resolve all threads
gh please pr review thread resolve <pr-number> --all [--repo owner/repo]
```

**Note:** The old command `gh please pr resolve` is deprecated but still works with a warning.

### Finding Thread Node IDs

**Use the thread list command (Recommended):**

```bash
# List all threads with Node IDs
gh please pr review thread list 456

# List only unresolved threads
gh please pr review thread list 456 --unresolved-only
```

The output includes copy-ready resolve commands with the correct Node IDs.

### Basic Usage

**Resolve all threads:**
```bash
gh please pr review thread resolve 456 --all
```

**Output:**
```
üîç Fetching review threads for PR #456...
‚úì Found 3 unresolved threads
‚úì Resolving 3 threads...
‚úì All threads resolved successfully

View: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/456
```

**Resolve specific thread:**
```bash
# Get Node ID from thread list command first
gh please pr review thread list 456

# Then resolve specific thread
gh please pr review thread resolve 456 --thread PRRT_kwDOABC123
```

**Output:**
```
‚úì Resolved thread PRRT_kwDOABC123
   View: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/456
```

### Cross-repository Usage

```bash
# Resolve threads in different repo
gh please pr review thread resolve 456 --all --repo owner/repo
gh please pr review thread resolve 456 --all -R owner/repo  # Short form
```

### When to Resolve vs Keep Open

**‚úÖ Resolve when:**
- Feedback addressed in latest commits
- Reviewer confirms satisfaction
- Discussion concluded with agreement
- Non-blocking suggestions implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è Keep open when:**
- Feedback not yet addressed
- Waiting for reviewer confirmation
- Controversial or ongoing discussion
- Requires further clarification

**Example decision tree:**
```
Review comment: "Add error handling"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Addressed? Yes
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Reviewer confirmed? Yes
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ RESOLVE
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Addressed? No
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ö†Ô∏è KEEP OPEN (reply with plan)
```

### Real-world Examples

**Example 1: After Comprehensive Update**

```bash
# 1. Address all review feedback
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Address PR review feedback"
git push

# 2. Resolve all threads
gh please pr review thread resolve 456 --all

# 3. Request re-review
gh pr ready 456
gh pr comment 456 --body "All feedback addressed, ready for re-review"
```

**Example 2: Selective Resolution**

```bash
# List unresolved threads
gh please pr review thread list 456 --unresolved-only

# Resolve specific threads by Node ID
gh please pr review thread resolve 456 --thread PRRT_kwDOABC123
gh please pr review thread resolve 456 --thread PRRT_kwDODEF456

# Leave remaining threads open for discussion
```

**Example 3: Automated Workflow**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# auto-resolve-after-push.sh

PR_NUMBER=$1

# 1. Ensure latest changes pushed
git push

# 2. Wait for CI to pass
gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER --watch

# 3. Resolve all threads if CI passes
if gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER | grep -q "All checks have passed"; then
  gh please pr review thread resolve $PR_NUMBER --all
  echo "‚úì All threads resolved, CI passed"
else
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è CI failed, keeping threads open"
fi
```

## Review Best Practices

### Effective Review Responses

**‚úÖ Good responses:**

Acknowledge and explain:
```
Good catch! I've refactored this to use...

Updated in commit abc123.
```

Provide context:
```
This approach was chosen because...

However, I can change to X if you prefer. Let me know!
```

Be specific:
```
Fixed by:
1. Adding validation (src/auth.ts:45)
2. Including tests (test/auth.test.ts:23)
3. Updating docs (README.md:67)
```

**‚ùå Poor responses:**

Too brief:
```
Fixed
```

Defensive:
```
This is fine as-is, no changes needed
```

Unclear:
```
I'll look into this later
```

### Managing Multiple Reviewers

**Scenario:** PR has 3 reviewers with conflicting feedback

**Strategy 1: Reply individually**
```bash
# Reviewer A wants approach X
gh please pr review reply 111 -b "Implemented X as suggested"

# Reviewer B wants approach Y (conflicts with X)
gh please pr review reply 222 -b "I went with X (per Reviewer A) because... Does this work for you?"

# Reviewer C: minor nits
gh please pr review reply 333 -b "Fixed all nits, thanks!"
```

**Strategy 2: Summary comment + resolve all**
```bash
# Post summary explaining decisions
gh pr comment 456 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Review Response Summary

Addressed all feedback:

**Reviewer A (@alice):** Implemented approach X ‚úÖ
**Reviewer B (@bob):** Went with X over Y because... ‚úÖ
**Reviewer C (@charlie):** Fixed all nits ‚úÖ

All changes in commits a1b2c3d..d4e5f6g.
Ready for re-review!
EOF
)"

# Resolve all threads
gh please pr review thread resolve 456 --all
```

### Handling Conflicting Feedback

**Pattern: Acknowledge, explain, propose**

```bash
gh pr comment 456 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Conflicting Feedback

@reviewer1 suggested approach A (async/await)
@reviewer2 suggested approach B (promises)

I've implemented approach A because:
1. More readable for this use case
2. Easier error handling
3. Consistent with rest of codebase

@reviewer2 - Does this work for you? Happy to discuss alternatives.
EOF
)"
```

### Review Etiquette

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Thank reviewers for their time
- ‚úÖ Explain your reasoning
- ‚úÖ Ask clarifying questions
- ‚úÖ Resolve threads promptly after addressing
- ‚úÖ Request re-review when ready

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Argue or be defensive
- ‚ùå Ignore feedback silently
- ‚ùå Resolve threads without addressing
- ‚ùå Leave stale comments unresolved
- ‚ùå Push without responding

**Example tone:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good
gh please pr review reply 111 -b "Great point! I've updated to use..."

# ‚ùå Bad
gh please pr review reply 111 -b "This is wrong, my approach is better"
```

## Practical Workflows

### Workflow 1: Incremental Response

Address feedback incrementally as you work:

```bash
# 1. Address first comment
git commit -m "fix: Add error handling (addresses PR comment #111)"
gh please pr review reply 111 -b "Added error handling, see commit abc123"

# 2. Address second comment
git commit -m "test: Add edge case tests (addresses PR comment #222)"
gh please pr review reply 222 -b "Added tests, see commit def456"

# 3. Continue for remaining comments...

# 4. Push all changes
git push

# 5. Resolve all threads
gh please pr review thread resolve 456 --all
```

### Workflow 2: Batch Response

Address all feedback, then respond to all comments:

```bash
# 1. Address all feedback
git commit -m "fix: Address all PR review feedback"
git push

# 2. Reply to each comment
COMMENTS=(111 222 333 444)
MESSAGE="Addressed in latest commit abc123"

for id in "${COMMENTS[@]}"; do
  gh please pr review reply $id -b "$MESSAGE"
done

# 3. Resolve all threads
gh please pr review thread resolve 456 --all

# 4. Request re-review
gh pr comment 456 -b "All feedback addressed, ready for re-review @reviewers"
```

### Workflow 3: Automated CI Integration

Resolve threads only if CI passes:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# review-response-workflow.sh

PR=$1

# 1. Address feedback
echo "Addressing review feedback..."
# ... make changes ...
git commit -am "fix: Address review feedback"
git push

# 2. Wait for CI
echo "Waiting for CI..."
gh pr checks $PR --watch

# 3. Respond based on CI result
if gh pr checks $PR --jq '.[] | select(.conclusion != "success")' | grep -q .; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è CI failed, not resolving threads"
  gh pr comment $PR -b "CI failing, will address before resolving threads"
else
  echo "‚úÖ CI passed, resolving threads"
  gh please pr review thread resolve $PR --all
  gh pr comment $PR -b "All feedback addressed, CI passing, ready for re-review"
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Comment not found"**
- Verify comment ID: `gh api /repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR/comments`
- Check permissions (repo access)
- Ensure comment is on correct PR

**"Cannot reply to nested comment"**
- API limitation: only top-level comments supported
- Use GitHub web UI for nested replies
- Or reply to the original top-level comment

**"Thread not resolved"**
- Check thread Node ID is correct (use `gh please pr review thread list`)
- Verify PR is in correct state (not merged/closed)
- Ensure you have write permissions

**"--all resolves wrong threads"**
- Extension resolves ALL unresolved threads
- Use `--thread` for selective resolution with Node ID
- Review threads with `thread list` before bulk resolution

**"Reply appears on wrong PR"**
- Comment Database ID might belong to different PR
- Verify comment ID from GitHub UI URL

## Tips and Tricks

### Template Responses

Create templates for common responses:

```bash
# ~/.gh-please/templates/review-thanks.txt
Thank you for the thorough review!

I've addressed all your feedback:
- <list changes here>

Please re-review when you have time.

# Use template
gh please pr review reply 111 --body "$(cat ~/.gh-please/templates/review-thanks.txt)"
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts (via aliases)

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias prreply='gh please pr review reply'
alias prresolve='gh please pr review thread resolve'
alias prthreads='gh please pr review thread list'

# Usage
prreply 111 -b "Fixed"
prthreads 456 --unresolved-only
prresolve 456 --all
```

### Batch Operations

```bash
# Reply to multiple comments
COMMENTS=(111 222 333 444)
for id in "${COMMENTS[@]}"; do
  gh please pr review reply $id -b "Addressed in latest commit"
done

# List unresolved threads and resolve selectively
gh please pr review thread list 456 --unresolved-only
# Copy Node IDs from output and resolve specific ones
gh please pr review thread resolve 456 --thread PRRT_kwDOABC123
```

### Integration with Git Hooks

```bash
# .git/hooks/post-push
#!/bin/bash
# Auto-respond to reviews after push

BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
PR=$(gh pr view $BRANCH --json number -q '.number' 2>/dev/null)

if [ -n "$PR" ]; then
  echo "Found PR #$PR for branch $BRANCH"
  read -p "Resolve all review threads? (y/n) " -n 1 -r
  echo
  if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    gh please pr review thread resolve $PR --all
  fi
fi
```

## pr review comment edit Command

### Purpose

Edit existing PR review comments.

### Syntax

```bash
gh please pr review comment edit <comment-id> --body <text> [--repo owner/repo]
```

### Usage

```bash
# Edit review comment (use Database ID from GitHub UI)
gh please pr review comment edit 1234567890 --body "Updated comment text"

# Multi-line edit
gh please pr review comment edit 1234567890 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Updated explanation:

1. Clarified the approach
2. Added code example
3. Referenced documentation
EOF
)"
```

**Finding comment Database ID:**
- GitHub UI: URL shows `#discussion_r1234567890` ‚Üí use `1234567890`
- Same ID used for `pr review reply` command
