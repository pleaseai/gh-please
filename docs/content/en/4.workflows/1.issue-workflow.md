# Issue Development Workflow

Follow this standardized workflow for all feature development and bug fixes using `gh-please`.

## Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Create issue branch              │
│    gh please issue develop <number> │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. Work in isolated worktree        │
│    cd ~/.please/worktrees/...       │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 3. Follow TDD cycle                 │
│    Red → Green → Refactor → Commit  │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 4. Commit, Push, and Create PR      │
│    git commit → git push → gh pr    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Step 1: Create Issue Branch

Start working on an issue with automatic worktree creation:

```bash
gh please issue develop <issue-number>
```

**This command:**
1. Checks if bare repo exists at `~/.please/repositories/{owner}/{repo}.git`
2. If not, prompts to clone as bare repository
3. Creates worktree at `~/.please/worktrees/{repo}/{branch}`
4. Links branch to issue via `gh issue develop`

**Example:**
```bash
# Start working on issue #123
gh please issue develop 123

# Output shows where to go
# cd ~/.please/worktrees/gh-please/feat-123-awesome-feature

# Navigate to worktree
cd ~/.please/worktrees/gh-please/feat-123-awesome-feature
```

**Options:**
```bash
# Use custom base branch
gh please issue develop 123 --base develop

# Use custom branch name
gh please issue develop 123 --name my-custom-branch

# From outside git repo
gh please issue develop 123 --repo owner/repo
```

## Step 2: Work in Isolated Worktree

Benefits of worktree-based development:

✅ **Isolated workspace** - Each issue has its own directory
✅ **No branch switching** - Work on multiple issues simultaneously
✅ **Clean state** - No risk of mixing changes
✅ **Efficient disk usage** - Shared Git objects

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Work on feature
cd ~/.please/worktrees/gh-please/feat-123-feature
code .

# Terminal 2: Fix urgent bug
cd ~/.please/worktrees/gh-please/fix-124-bug
code .

# No branch switching needed!
```

## Step 3: Follow TDD Cycle

Implement changes following Test-Driven Development:

### Red Phase: Write Failing Test

```bash
# Write test that defines desired behavior
bun test --watch
```

### Green Phase: Implement Minimum Code

```bash
# Make the test pass with simplest solution
```

### Refactor Phase: Improve Code

```bash
# Improve structure while keeping tests passing
bun run lint:fix
bun run type-check
```

### Commit Phase: Save Progress

```bash
# Small, focused commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add validation logic"
```

**Key commands:**
```bash
# Run tests continuously
bun test --watch

# Run all quality checks
bun run lint:fix && bun run type-check && bun test
```

## Step 4: Commit, Push, and Create PR

Once implementation is complete:

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Create commit following conventional commit format
git commit -m "feat: brief description"

# Push to remote
git push -u origin <branch-name>

# Create pull request
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "Description"
```

**Or use the shorthand:**
```bash
# Commit, push, and create PR in one command
/commit-commands:commit-push-pr
```

## Step 5: Cleanup After Merge

Once PR is merged and branch is deleted:

```bash
# Remove worktree interactively
gh please issue cleanup

# Or remove all prunable worktrees
gh please issue cleanup --all
```

## Working with Sub-Issues

Break down large issues into manageable sub-tasks:

```bash
# Create parent issue #100: "Implement user authentication"

# Create sub-issues
gh please issue sub-issue create 100 --title "Add login form"
gh please issue sub-issue create 100 --title "Add session management"
gh please issue sub-issue create 100 --title "Add password reset"

# List all sub-issues
gh please issue sub-issue list 100

# Work on each sub-issue separately
gh please issue develop 101  # Login form
gh please issue develop 102  # Session management
```

## Managing Dependencies

Handle dependencies between issues:

```bash
# Issue #200 depends on #199
gh please issue dependency add 200 --blocked-by 199

# Check blockers before starting work
gh please issue dependency list 200

# Remove dependency when blocker is resolved
gh please issue dependency remove 200 199
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Small, Focused Issues

- Break large tasks into sub-issues
- Each issue should be completable in 1-3 days
- Clear acceptance criteria

### 2. Descriptive Branch Names

Let `gh issue develop` create branches automatically with issue context:
- `feat-123-add-authentication`
- `fix-456-validation-error`

### 3. Regular Commits

- Commit after each red-green-refactor cycle
- Use conventional commit messages
- Keep commits small and focused

### 4. Clean Worktrees

- Remove worktrees after PR merge
- Run `gh please issue cleanup` regularly
- Keep `~/.please/worktrees/` organized

### 5. Link Issues and PRs

- Create PR with `gh pr create`
- Reference issue in PR description: "Closes #123"
- Link sub-issues to parent

## Troubleshooting

### Worktree Already Exists

```bash
# Error: worktree already exists

# Option 1: Navigate to existing worktree
cd ~/.please/worktrees/gh-please/feat-123-feature

# Option 2: Remove and recreate
gh please issue cleanup
gh please issue develop 123
```

### Bare Repo Not Found

```bash
# First run will prompt to clone
gh please issue develop 123
# Would you like to clone? (y/n)
```

### Want to Use Checkout Instead

```bash
# Use traditional checkout in current repo
gh please issue develop 123 --checkout
```
