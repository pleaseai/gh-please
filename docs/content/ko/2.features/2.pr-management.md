# PR Management

Streamline your pull request review workflow with powerful comment and thread management.

## Review Reply

Reply to pull request review comments directly from the command line.

### Basic Reply

```bash
gh please pr review reply <comment-id> --body "Reply text"
# Short form: -b
```

**Finding Comment ID:**

1. **From GitHub Web UI:**
   - Click on review comment
   - URL shows: `github.com/.../pull/123#discussion_r1234567890`
   - Use the number after `discussion_r` (e.g., `1234567890`)

2. **Using GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   gh api /repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments
   ```

3. **List all comments:**
   ```bash
   gh pr view --json comments --jq '.comments[] | "\(.id): \(.body)"'
   ```

### Multi-line Reply

```bash
gh please pr review reply 1234567890 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Great catch! I've addressed this by:
1. Adding proper error handling
2. Including unit tests
3. Updating documentation

Let me know if there are other concerns.

```

### Reply from Stdin

```bash
echo "Thanks for the review!" | gh please pr review reply 1234567890
cat reply.txt | gh please pr review reply 1234567890
```

## Thread Resolution

Resolve review threads after addressing feedback.

### Resolve All Threads

```bash
gh please pr review thread resolve <pr-number> --all
```

**Example:**
```bash
gh please pr review thread resolve 456 --all
```

### Resolve Specific Thread

```bash
gh please pr review thread resolve <pr-number> --thread <thread-id>
```

**Getting Thread ID:**
```bash
# List all threads
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $number: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
      pullRequest(number: $number) {
        reviewThreads(first: 100) {
          nodes {
            id
            isResolved
            comments(first: 1) {
              nodes {
                path
                body
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
' -F owner=OWNER -F repo=REPO -F number=PR_NUMBER
```

## Comment Management

### List Review Comments

```bash
gh please pr comment list <pr-number> [--format json|markdown|xml]
```

**Output formats:**
- `json` - Machine-readable JSON
- `markdown` - Human-readable Markdown (default)
- `xml` - Structured XML for LLM processing

**Example:**
```bash
gh please pr comment list 456
gh please pr comment list 456 --format json
```

### Edit Review Comment

```bash
gh please pr review comment edit <comment-id> --body "Updated text"
```

**Example:**
```bash
gh please pr review comment edit 123456789 --body "Clarification: this applies to v2.0+"
```

## PR Review Workflow

Complete workflow for handling code review feedback:

### 1. Receive Review Feedback

```bash
# View PR with comments
gh pr view 456
```

### 2. Address Feedback

```bash
# Make code changes
# Run tests, lint, etc.
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address review feedback"
git push
```

### 3. Respond to Comments

```bash
# Reply to each review comment
gh please pr review reply 2442802556 -b "Fixed in commit abc123"
gh please pr review reply 2442802557 -b "Updated in commit abc123"
```

```

## API Limitations

### Top-Level Comments Only

The GitHub API endpoint used for replies:
```
POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies
```

**Important:** This endpoint only accepts **top-level review comments**.

**Works:**
- ✅ Replying to review comments on specific lines
- ✅ Replying to review comments on files

**Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ Replying to replies (nested replies)

### Rate Limits

GitHub API has rate limits. For authenticated requests (via `gh` CLI):
- 5,000 requests per hour for user-server requests

Check current rate limit:
```bash
gh api rate_limit
```

## Common Options

All PR commands support:
- `--repo owner/repo` or `-R owner/repo` - Target different repository
- `--format json|markdown|xml` - Output format (list commands only)

## Deprecated Commands

These commands still work but show deprecation warnings:

- `gh please review-reply` → Use `gh please pr review reply`
- `gh please pr review-reply` → Use `gh please pr review reply`
- `gh please pr resolve` → Use `gh please pr review thread resolve`
